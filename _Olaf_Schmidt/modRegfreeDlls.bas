'A readymade "PlugIn-Module" you can include into your Projects, to be able to load Classes from COM-Dlls
'without registering them priorily - and just to be clear - there is no "dynamic re-registering" involved -
'DirectCOM.dll will load the appropriate Class-Instances without touching the Systems Registry in any way...
'
'There's 3 Functions exposed from this Module:
'- GetInstanceFromBinFolder ... loads Classes from Dlls located in a SubFolder, relative to your Exe-Path
'- GetInstance              ... same as above - but allowing absolute Dll-Paths (anywhere in the FileSystem)
'- GetExePath               ... just a small helper, to give the correct Exe-Path, even when called from within Dlls
'
'the approach is *very* reliable (in use for nearly two decades now, it works from Win98 to Windows-10)
'So, happy regfree COM-Dll-loading... :-) (Olaf Schmidt, in Dec. 2014)
