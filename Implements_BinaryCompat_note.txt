
only the default interface of a class is subject to binary compatability.
any other interfaces added using Implements keyword are not affected and can
be changed. 

thats awesome in practice, you can extend your old classes that multiple projects
depend on without breaking every other project or having to compile a whole new
myClass4.cls
